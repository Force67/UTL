<strong>U</strong>niversal <strong>U</strong>tility <strong>L</strong>ibrary is a small project, which is used as a base dependency in projects such as PS4Delta, and FormatX. It provides a few core features for platform abstraction and convenience, as well as helpers for making my life easier.
<hr>

This library requires C++17 support.
Where possible, C++14/17 STL should be used instead of adding any code in here, and the code should be kept as small as possible (by reusing STL/etc). Third party dependencies should be kept to a minimum. 
- *Note that this library does not support linux yet*

Supported/Tested compilers:

* MSVC++ 2017+
* Clang 10+ (on windows)
